 <h1>CRICKET, FOOTBALL, GYM,<br> GAMING, CODING </h1>
<p>We often think of our mind and body as separate, but our mental health and physical health are interconnected. It is very important for me to stay healthy. I started playing cricket in 6th grade as a team captain. which also helps me with leadership skills. Gaming makes my mental health good too. Recently, I joined a gym for physical fitness. All these things make my mind good for coding.</p>
